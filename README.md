🎮 How to Play
The game will randomly light up a sequence of buttons.
Your task is to repeat the sequence by clicking the correct buttons in the same order.
Each time you successfully complete the sequence, the game will add another step to the sequence.
If you click the wrong button, the game is over, and your score will be shown.
